# Datasets
A nice little list of datasets and python scripts to get them

Has a list of datasets for NLPs, CNNs, etc. There are Python scripts with methods for retreiving the data contained within these. I have prepared each dataset myself, each one spans one thousand examples (they are micro datasets for homemade projects).
